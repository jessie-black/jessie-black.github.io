## Personal Portfolio
This website is designed both as a professional portfolio to showcase my training, education, work experience, and projects as well as a documentation of my continued learning journey in computer science.

The initial template uses the Solid State template from HTML5 UP, found <a href = "https://html5up.net/solid-state">here</a>, and not only the content but also the design has been altered to customize the site.

## Software & languages used
- HTML
- CSS
- VS Code 

## Changes made
- Added highlights of experience in CS coursework, specialized certification in Data Science & Data Engineering, programming languages & leadership/communication
- Adjusted contact information, using CSS & Font Awesome to streamline to 3 single links with icons
- Shifted icon & favicon using Font Awesome & CSS

## Future changes
- Add resume in detail on separate page, link highlights on main page to resume
- Figure out which icon to use (currently glasses or dragon) & examine why showing up in Safari but not Chrome.
- Add portfolio project summaries & links as I add new repositories
- Consider blog format/articles on learning journey as I revisit topics? This may lead to clutter & be overkill.
